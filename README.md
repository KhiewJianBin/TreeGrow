# Features
  1. Choice to spawn 4 different types of "Fruits" on current tree branches
  
# Install
  No Installation Required. Just Git clone or direct download

## Usage
  1. Run [TreeGrow.exe](https://github.com/KhiewJianBin/TreeGrow/blob/main/TreeGrow.exe) in folder

## **How it works?**
1. Recursively create 1-2 new branches nodes at the ends on existing leaf nodes every cycle
2. Chances and number increase after reach cycle
3. New tree branches have random direction angle offset from parent
